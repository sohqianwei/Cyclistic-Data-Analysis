# Cyclistic-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification capstone. The goal of the Cyclistic Case Study is to analyze a bike-share dataset to uncover trends and insights that can inform a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. The dataset contains trip data from Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company. The Cyclistic dataset comes from Divvy, a bike-sharing system in Chicago, operated by Lyft. The dataset is publicly available through the City of Chicago's open data portal 

## Objectives:

1. Identify usage patterns among casual riders and annual members.
2. Provide actionable recommendations to improve member conversion rates.
3. Showcase data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills.

## Features

* Data Cleaning: Processed raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated user behavior, ride duration, and trip types.
* Visualizations: Created charts and graphs to present insights.
* Actionable Recommendations: Provided strategies to motivate casual riders to become members.

## Technology Stack

* Python: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
* SQL: Querying and analyzing data stored in databases.
* Tableau: Designed dashboards to present insights interactively.
* Spreadsheet Tools: Conducted initial exploration and data validation.

## Instructions for Running the Project

### Prerequisites:

1. Install Python (3.8 or higher) and the required libraries:pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
2. Access Tableau Public for visualizations.

### Steps:

1. Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/sohqianwei/Cyclistic-Data-Analysis.git

2. cd Cyclistic-Data-Analysis
3. Data Cleaning and Analysis on Python:
    * Use cyclistic-data-analysis.ipynb
4. Data Cleaning and Analysis on SQL:
    * Use cyclistic-data-analysis.sql

5. Data Cleaning and Analysis on R:
    * Use cyclistic-data-analysis.R

6. Visualizations:
    * Open cyclistic_dashboard.twb in Tableau Desktop to view the interactive dashboards.

7. Report:
    * Refer to cyclistic-data-analysis-report.pdf for the final findings and recommendations.

## Analysis Insights

1. Ride Length: Casual riders took longer rides for recreational use in summer and spring, and peak periods while annual members had consistent ride lengths across all seasons. 
2. Day of Week: Casual riders peaked on weekends while annual members had consistent use throughout the week. 
3. Seasonal Change: Casual riders show drastic reduction in winter as outdoor recreational use decreases, rose during spring and spiked during summer for leisure and tourism. Annual members maintained steady usage and increased rides during summer alongside regular commuting. 

## Recommendations

1. Targeted promotion during peak month.
2. Benefits tailored to long but infrequent trips.
3. Priority access or discounts for peak time riders.
